# String-Bag
Has an unbounded and bounded implementation of storing strings. 
The unbounded means of storage use a basic linked list class to store strings in nodes
The bounded means of storage use an array of a fixed size determined by the user. 

Unbounded Bag Implementation - Can enter as many strings as they would like

Bounded Bag Implementation - limited by the number of strings they choose, but can also end input early by typing in "XXX"
