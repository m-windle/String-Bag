# String-Bag
Has an unbounded and bounded implementation of storing strings. 
The unbounded means of storage use a basic linked list class to store strings in nodes
The bounded means of storage use an array of a fixed size determined by the user. 

Requests users to select which implementation they would like. 
The user then has the ability to select a name for their "String Bag".
If they choose to use a bounded bag, they are requested to choose the size of their bag (how many strings they can store).
Once they fill the bag (or type "XXX" to end input), a random string is selected, displayed, and removed from the bag.
The user is also shown the rest of the contents of the bag.
